# Object Oriented Programming Functions (OOP)
## DRY 
- DONT REPEAT YOURSELF 
## Use Cases

## What is a function and why is it useful?
  - In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

## How to create a function?
 
- ```def``` is the key word that tells the interpreter that the functions is being declared

## Function structure and arguments 
- after we use ```def``` we name the function and put the arguments in the brackets 

```python
def add(num1, num2):    # This function passes 2 args and adds the two values
   print(num1 + num2)
add(3,6)
```
